## 📖 How to Use: The PickleFlow Path

Running a perfect session is as easy as 1-2-3-4:

### 1. Build Your Squad
Navigate to the **Setup** screen. Add your players by name. 
- *Pro Tip:* You can edit names at any time by tapping on them.
- Need a fresh start? Use the **Wipe** button to clear the roster, or **Clear Match Data** for a full factory reset.

### 2. Configure the Courts
Set your session parameters:
- **Rounds**: How many games should each person play?
- **Game Len**: Set the match timer (usually 15-20 mins).
- **Courts**: How many courts are available for play? 
*PickleFlow will automatically calculate the "Resting Squad" if you have more players than court capacity.*

### 3. Launch & Play
Tap **Launch Round Robin**. You’ll be taken to the **Play** screen:
- Start the timer when the first ball is served.
- Enter scores as matches finish.
- Tap **Submit Final Score** to lock a result. 
- Once all courts are done (or time is up), tap **Next Round**.

### 4. Review & Share
At any point, switch to the **Stats** or **Schedule** tabs:
- **Schedule**: View the full day's pairings. Use the **Filter** to show a specific player their personal schedule for the day.
- **Stats**: View the live leaderboard. When the session ends, use the **Export Standings** button to copy the final results to your clipboard or share them directly to your group chat.
